AEGIS Ω — adversarial controls for `WeilDigammaIntegralReductionV1`.

`tsum_seriesTerm_eq_integral` is an equality between two quantities that a
mis-stated definition could render simultaneously `0`, or simultaneously
undefined-and-totalised-to-`0`.  These controls rule that out by evaluating both
sides independently at `z = 2`, where the answer is known by hand:

  * the integrand collapses, `(e^{-u} - e^{-2u}) / (1 - e^{-u}) = e^{-u}`, so the
    right-hand side is `∫_0^∞ e^{-u} du = 1`;
  * the series telescopes, `∑_{n≥0} (1/(n+1) - 1/(n+2)) = 1`.

Both are proved here WITHOUT using `tsum_seriesTerm_eq_integral`.  Their
agreement at `1` is therefore an independent check of the main theorem, and the
value `1` is nonzero, so neither side is vacuous.  (`ψ(2) + γ = 1` is the
classical value, consistent with the half of Gauss's formula this module does
not prove.)

divides by zero, and Lean's totalised division silently returns `1` rather than
diverging.  `0 < z.re` in the main theorem is therefore not decoration: without
it the left-hand side is a junk value, not the classical series. -/
