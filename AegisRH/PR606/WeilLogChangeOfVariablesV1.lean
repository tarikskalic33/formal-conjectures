AEGIS Ω — the log change of variables x = e^u, V1.  (Step (ii).)

`WeilArchimedeanPacketWitnessV1` listed three things needed to discharge
`ArchimedeanPacketReductionV1`:

  (i)   a packet whose log-support sits inside [-1/32, 1/32]   — PROVED there;
  (ii)  the change of variables x = e^u                        — THIS MODULE;
  (iii) autocorrelation vanishing outside the log-support      — still OPEN.

`WeilMomentKillerConstructionV1` proved that φ = ψ' + ψ'' kills both additive
moments, ∫_ℝ φ = 0 and ∫_ℝ φ(u) e^u du = 0, but explicitly did NOT claim
`WeilMomentConditionsV1`, which is a statement about multiplicative integrals
∫_{Ioi 0} g dx/x and ∫_{Ioi 0} g dx for g : ℝ → ℂ.  This module supplies the
missing transport and then discharges that statement.

THE TRANSPORT

Mathlib has `integral_comp_log_Ioi` and `integral_comp_exp_Ioi`, but only over
`Ioi a` with `a > 0` — neither reaches down to 0, because in the log coordinate
that is -∞.  Compact support is exactly what bridges the gap: if φ vanishes on
`Iic b` then the multiplicative integrand vanishes on `Ioc 0 (exp b)`, so the
integral over `Ioi 0` already equals the integral over `Ioi (exp b)`, where
Mathlib's lemma applies.  `integral_Ioi_zero_eq_Ioi` and
`integral_Ioi_eq_integral` are those two extensions, and they are the only
analytic content here; the rest is bookkeeping.

    ∫_{Ioi 0} x⁻¹ φ(log x) dx = ∫_ℝ φ(u) du
    ∫_{Ioi 0} φ(log x) dx     = ∫_ℝ φ(u) e^u du

THE PACKET IS A MEMBER, NOT JUST AN INTEGRAND

`mulPacket φ x = if 0 < x then φ (log x) else 0` needs the guard: Mathlib's
`Real.log` is even (`log (-x) = log x`) and `log 0 = 0`, so the unguarded
composite `φ ∘ log` takes the same value at `-x` as at `x`.  Any value it takes
inside the support is therefore mirrored onto the negative axis, which
`tsupport ⊆ Ioi 0` forbids.  (This module proves the evenness, which is the
mechanism; it does not compute `phi0 0` and so does not claim the unguarded
composite is in fact nonzero at any particular mirrored point.)

Smoothness of the guarded function is proved, not assumed: `Ioi 0` and
`Iio (exp b)` are two open sets covering ℝ (because `exp b > 0`), the packet is
`φ ∘ log` on the first and identically `0` on the second, so `ContDiffAt` holds
at every point by `ContDiffAt.congr_of_eventuallyEq`.

WHAT THIS CLOSES

`weilMomentConditions_gWitness` discharges `WeilMomentConditionsV1` for the
concrete ℂ-valued packet `gWitness` built from `phi0`, and the restated
definitions it is stated against were diffed byte-identical against
`WeilCriterionCompactSmoothV1.lean` on `proof/weil-analytic-v21-probe`.

`gWitness_log_support` then shows the SAME packet also satisfies (i): its
support sits inside [exp(-1/32), exp(1/32)].  So steps (i) and (ii) are
discharged by one object, not by two different ones — the bump packet of
`WeilArchimedeanPacketWitnessV1` satisfied (i) but provably could not satisfy
the moment conditions, and is superseded here.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT CLOSE

Step (iii), autocorrelation vanishing outside the log-support, is untouched.
`ArchimedeanPacketReductionV1` is still quantified over and never constructed —
its `reduction` field asserts `arch = D * nrm2`, an identity about the
archimedean form, and nothing here computes that form.

`ANALYTIC_DIAGONAL_LOWER_V1`, the global Weil sign and RH all remain OPEN.
This module proves no sign and no part of RH.
