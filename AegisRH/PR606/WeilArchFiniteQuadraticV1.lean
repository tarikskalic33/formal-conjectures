AEGIS Ω — fixed-T finite Archimedean quadratic module boundary v1.

The actual definitions and proofs live in `WeilArchSineKernelIntegerV1`, where
they were proved directly from the true Archimedean sine source and the
rank-two Cauchy entry identity.  This file deliberately re-exports that
already-kernel-checked surface as the preregistered module boundary.

It adds no theorem and grants no stronger claim.  Continuous T-integration,
the full Archimedean weight, tail operator order, full finite Galerkin PSD,
formula-to-Weil operator identity, global Weil positivity, RH, repository
admission, merge, and authority effects remain outside this module.
